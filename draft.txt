The exclusion of ground magnetometer data in forecasting models is often done to prevent the models from over-relying on the ground magnetometer data and becoming no
better than a simple persistence model (citations). However, using only solar wind data from the L1 monitors as input to forecasting models presents a different issue.
In their study on Region-to-Specific Difference (RSD), Dimmock (2020) was able to find correlations between solar wind parameters and the difference in dB/dt between
a single magnetometer station and the average dB/dt value of nearby stations. Specifically, they found that when Bz was southward and the solar wind velocity is elevated
RSD could reach more than 100 nT/min, meaning that the differences in the dB/dt measured at stations close to one another could differ by a similar degree. If we are
creating forecasting models for stations close to one another using only solar wind parameters, we are only supplying the models with data that correlates to differences
in station dB/dt values. If the differences between the station values are consistent and one of the stations is always the one with higher values ex. for geological
reasons, the models may be able to learn this behavior and make appropriate forecasts for each station. However, Ngwira et al found that localized dB/dt can be attributed to
magnetospheric and ionospheric processes, indicating that RSD would not always be attributable to one station consistently having higher dB/dt values. If this is the case
we must seek to include additional information as input to the models. Here, we include ground magnetometer data from the SuperMAG network as its data overlaps well with
the solar wind monitors, and it represents the final stange in the chain from sun to changes in teh ground mangnetic field. Future work will seek to include additional
data from sources in between the sun and earth's surface. To evaluate how the additional ground magnetometer input parameters affect the models, we compare a model
using only solar wind inputs to one using solar wind and ground magnetometer inputs. By using input data at time t, we predict the probability of dB/dt exceeding
a threshold value in a time window set from t+30 to t+60.
