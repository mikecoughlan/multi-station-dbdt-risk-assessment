Model Explainability

Machine learning algorithms have enormous potential for space weather forecasting due to their fast deployment and ability to continuily improve
as new data becomes avalible via online/offline learning. One of the drawbacks of utilizing neural networks such as the one featured in this work
is the difficulty in determining the driving factors in the model's output. The so called black box or
opaque box problem presents a a practical issue for space weather forecasters who may need to know why a model outputs an elevated risk,
but more fundementally it does not allow us to determine whether these data-driven models align with our physical understanding of the underlying
processes. This could lead to models with misleading outputs and could inhibit our ability to make data driven discoveries. In response to the
increased use of machine learning in space weather there has been a movement towards using methods more attuned to explainability (such as one of
the many tree based models), or to utilize methods of interpreting model predictions such as SHAP (cite Lundberg).

The SHAP method for determining feature importance is based on Shapley values (cite shapley) and uses cooperative game theory to determine the
marginal contribution of model input parameters. In theory it does this by using an additive feature method that retrains the model for all
input feature subsets. In assigning an importance value to each feature the method compares the retrained model of a subset including the feature,
and one trained with the same subset but the feature witheld. To account for the affect of the other features in teh set on withholding the feature
being examined it repeats this process for all possible subsets and features. The final determinination of the feature importance is determined by
takinga weighted average of all the individual importance values. In practice this is prohibitivly expensive as it requires retraining N! models
where N is the number of input features, which in our case would be either 10! for the solar wind model or 16! for the combined model.
