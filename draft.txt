The exclusion of ground magnetometer data in forecasting models is often done to prevent the models from over-relying on ground
magnetic field data and becoming no better than a simple persistence model (citations). However, using only solar wind data from the L1
monitors as input to forecasting models presents a different issue. In their study on Region-to-Specific Difference (RSD), Dimmock (2020)
was able to find correlations between solar wind parameters and differences in dB/dt between a single magnetometer station and the
average dB/dt value of nearby stations. Specifically, they found that when Bz was southward and the solar wind velocity is elevated
RSD could reach more than 100 nT/min, meaning that the differences in the dB/dt measured at stations close to one another could differ
by a similar magnitude during storm time conditions. In creating forecasting models for stations close to one another using only solar
wind parameters, we are only supplying the models with data that correlates high RSD. If the differences between the station
values are consistent and one of the stations is always the one with higher values ex. for geological reasons

(internal magnetotelluric currents
can contribute up to tens of percent to the total dB/dt value measured at a magnetometer station (Dimmock discussion section)),

the models may be able
to learn this behavior and make appropriate forecasts for each station. However, Ngwira et al found that localized dB/dt can be attributed to
magnetospheric and ionospheric processes, indicating that RSD cannot always be attributable to one station consistently having higher
dB/dt values. If this is the case we must seek to include additional inputs to forecasting models to caputre localized information. Here,
we include ground magnetometer data from the SuperMAG network as its data overlaps well with the solar wind monitors, and it represents the
final stage in the chain from sun to ground mangnetic field fluctuations. Future work will seek to include additional data from sources in
between the sun and earth's surface. To evaluate how the additional ground magnetometer input parameters affect the models, we compare a
model using only solar wind inputs to one using solar wind and ground magnetometer inputs. By using input data at time t, we predict the
probability of dB/dt exceeding a threshold value in a time window set from t+30 to t+60.
